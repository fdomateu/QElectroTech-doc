Single line diagram
=====================

The single line diagrams represent electric, fluid, etc. systems using a simplified notation.

`Single line conductors`_ are used to draw single line diagrams.

.. note::

   At electric schemas, the power system is represended with a simplified notation and the control system is not represented. The `conductors`_ only represent power cables.

   At fluid power schemas, the pressure and return line are represented by the same `conductor`_.
