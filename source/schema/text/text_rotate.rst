Rotate text
===========

The content from a `text field`_ can be rotated in two different ways:

    1. Rotating the `text field`_ as an object.
    2. Defining the text orientation inside the `text field`_.

Rotate the text field
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The text field is considered an object by QElectroTech, it can be selected, placed and rotated as 
`elements`_ and `pictures`_. It can be rorated 90, 180 or 270 degrees.

    1. Right click on the `text field`_ which should be rotated.

        .. figure:: ../../images/qet_text_field_right_click.png
            :align: center

            Figure: QElectroTech text field options

    2. Select the option **Rotate** to rotate the `text field`_ 90 degrees on the clock direction. 

.. seealso::

   For more information about rotating objects at the `workspace`_, refer to `rotate object section`_.

Define text orientation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Defining the text orientation rotates only the content from the `text field`_. The advantage 
of choosing the text orientation is the possibility to choose any angle value between -360 and 
360 degrees. 

    1. Right click on the `text field`_ which should be oriented.

        .. figure:: ../../images/qet_text_field_right_click.png
            :align: center

            Figure: QElectroTech text field options

    2. Select the option **Choose text orientation** to display the text orientation PopUP window.

        .. figure:: ../../images/qet_text_field_orientation.png
            :align: center

    3. Define the angle of orientation from the text.
    4. Press **OK** to save the changes and close the text orientation PopUP window.
