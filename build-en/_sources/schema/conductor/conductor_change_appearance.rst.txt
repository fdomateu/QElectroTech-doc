Change appearance conductor
============================

QElectroTech allows changing the `conductors appearance`_, the line style and color can be defined 
for each `conductor`_. 

To change the conductor appearance:

    1. `Select the conductor`_ which should be edited. 
    2. `Display conductor properties`_ PopUp window.
    3. Go to **Appearance** tab.

        .. figure:: ../../images/qet_conductor_properties_appearance.png
            :align: center

    4. Choose the desired parameters for main color and secondary color if necessary.
    5. Click the check buttom **Apply properties to all conductor of this potential** if the changes should be applied for all `conductor`_ with common initial or end `terminal`_.
    5. Click or unclick the option **Apply properties to all conductors of this potential**.
    6. Press **OK** button to save and apply the property changes.
