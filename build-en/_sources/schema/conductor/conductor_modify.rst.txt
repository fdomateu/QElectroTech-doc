Modify conductor

QElectrotech draws by default a `conductor`_ minimizing the horizontal and vertical lines. 
Changing the route of the `conductor`_ for a clear understanding of the `schema`_ is some times necessary. 
QElectroTech allows modifying the route.

   Figure: QElectroTech modify conductor

To modify the route of a `conductor`_:

    1. `Select the conductor`_ which route should be modified.
    2. Press on a control point, blue points, from the `conductor`_ selected.
    3. Without releasing the control point, displace the control point horizontally or vertically until desired position.
