Define text at conductor
========================

QElectroTech allows defining and displaying information text at each `conductor`_. 

.. note::

   Only `multiline conductors`_ allow text definition.

To define the conductor text:

    1. `Select the conductor`_ which should be edited. 
    2. `Display conductor properties`_ PopUp window.
    3. Go to multiline section from **Type** tab.

        .. figure:: ../../images/qet_conductor_properties_type_multiline.png
            :align: center

            Figure: QElectroTech multiline conductor text section

    4. Choose the desired parametes for text positioning, text content or formula, text size, etc.
    5. Click the check buttom **Apply properties to all conductor of this potential** if the changes should be applied for all `conductor`_ with common initial or end `terminal`_.
    6. Press **OK** button to save and apply the property changes.
