Control diagram
===============

A control diagram is a representation of the logic from a system, it is a model of the process to automate considering inputs, actions to be carried out and the intermediate processes that cause these actions.

`Single line conductors`_ are used to draw control diagrams.

.. note::

   QElectroTech can represent processes using `IEC 61131-3`_ standards (Ex.: GRAFCET, Ladder, etc.).
